# Liquidation Mechanics

## Overview

Liquidation is the automatic closure of a trader's position when their margin falls below the maintenance margin requirement. This protects the exchange from losses and ensures market stability.

## Why Liquidation is Necessary

### Risk Management
- **Exchange Protection**: Prevents exchange losses from bankrupt accounts
- **Market Stability**: Maintains orderly market conditions
- **Counterparty Risk**: Reduces risk to other traders
- **Capital Preservation**: Protects trader's remaining capital

### Market Mechanics
- **Zero-Sum Game**: For every winner, there's a loser
- **Leverage Risk**: Amplified losses require protection
- **Price Volatility**: Sudden moves can wipe out margin
- **System Integrity**: Ensures fair and transparent trading

## Liquidation Process

### Pre-Liquidation Warnings
```
Margin Ratio Levels:
> 150%: Safe zone
100-150%: Warning notifications
50-100%: Danger zone, multiple alerts
< 50%: Liquidation imminent
```

### Liquidation Triggers
1. **Margin Ratio**: Falls below maintenance margin
2. **Price Movement**: Adverse price action
3. **Manual Trigger**: Exchange intervention
4. **System Failure**: Technical issues

### Liquidation Execution
1. **Position Closure**: Automatic market order
2. **Fee Assessment**: Liquidation fee (typically 0.5-2%)
3. **Loss Calculation**: Realized PnL determination
4. **Balance Update**: Account balance adjustment

## Liquidation Price Calculation

### Long Position Liquidation
```
Liquidation Price = Entry Price × (1 - 1/Leverage + Maintenance Margin Rate)

Example:
Entry: $45,000
Leverage: 10x
Maintenance Margin: 2%
Liquidation Price = $45,000 × (1 - 1/10 + 0.02)
Liquidation Price = $45,000 × (1 - 0.1 + 0.02)
Liquidation Price = $45,000 × 0.92
Liquidation Price = $41,400
```

### Short Position Liquidation
```
Liquidation Price = Entry Price × (1 + 1/Leverage - Maintenance Margin Rate)

Example:
Entry: $45,000
Leverage: 10x
Maintenance Margin: 2%
Liquidation Price = $45,000 × (1 + 1/10 - 0.02)
Liquidation Price = $45,000 × (1 + 0.1 - 0.02)
Liquidation Price = $45,000 × 1.08
Liquidation Price = $48,600
```

## Liquidation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Gradual Price Movement
```
Initial Position: Long 1 BTC at $45,000, 10x leverage
Initial Margin: $4,500
Maintenance Margin: $900

Price drops to $42,000:
- Unrealized PnL: -$3,000
- Remaining Margin: $1,500
- Margin Ratio: 167% (safe)

Price drops to $41,400:
- Unrealized PnL: -$3,600
- Remaining Margin: $900
- Margin Ratio: 100% (liquidation trigger)
```

### Scenario 2: Gap Down
```
Initial Position: Long 1 BTC at $45,000, 10x leverage
Overnight gap to $40,000:
- Unrealized PnL: -$5,000
- Remaining Margin: -$500
- Immediate liquidation
- Bankruptcy price reached
```

## Bankruptcy Price

### Definition
The bankruptcy price is where a position's losses equal the total margin, leaving zero remaining balance.

### Long Position Bankruptcy
```
Bankruptcy Price = Entry Price × (1 - 1/Leverage)

Example:
Entry: $45,000, Leverage: 10x
Bankruptcy Price = $45,000 × (1 - 1/10)
Bankruptcy Price = $45,000 × 0.9
Bankruptcy Price = $40,500
```

### Short Position Bankruptcy
```
Bankruptcy Price = Entry Price × (1 + 1/Leverage)

Example:
Entry: $45,000, Leverage: 10x
Bankruptcy Price = $45,000 × (1 + 1/10)
Bankruptcy Price = $45,000 × 1.1
Bankruptcy Price = $49,500
```

## Liquidation Types

### Partial Liquidation
- **Trigger**: Margin ratio between 50-100%
- **Action**: Close portion of position
- **Benefit**: Preserves remaining position
- **Risk**: May trigger full liquidation

### Full Liquidation
- **Trigger**: Margin ratio below 50%
- **Action**: Close entire position
- **Benefit**: Complete risk elimination
- **Risk**: Maximum loss realization

### Emergency Liquidation
- **Trigger**: System failure or extreme volatility
- **Action**: Manual intervention
- **Benefit**: Market stability
- **Risk**: Suboptimal execution

## Liquidation Fees

### Standard Fees
- **Liquidation Fee**: 0.5-2% of position value
- **Processing Fee**: Fixed amount per liquidation
- **Market Impact**: Slippage from market orders
- **Insurance Fund**: Contribution if needed

### Fee Calculation
```
Total Liquidation Cost = Position Value × Liquidation Fee Rate + Processing Fee

Example:
Position: 1 BTC at $45,000
Liquidation Fee: 1%
Processing Fee: $10
Total Cost = $45,000 × 0.01 + $10 = $460
```

## Insurance Fund

### Purpose
- **Cover Losses**: Absorb liquidation losses
- **Market Stability**: Prevent cascading liquidations
- **User Protection**: Minimize trader losses
- **System Integrity**: Maintain exchange solvency

### Funding Sources
