# Profit & Loss Across All Users

## Overview

In a derivatives exchange, the total profit and loss (PnL) across all users must sum to zero (excluding fees). This zero-sum nature is fundamental to how derivatives markets work and ensures system integrity.

## Zero-Sum Nature of Derivatives

### Core Principle
```
Total PnL Across All Users = 0 (excluding fees)

For every winner, there must be a loser of equal magnitude.
```

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Long Position**: Profit when price rises, loss when price falls
- **Short Position**: Profit when price falls, loss when price rises
- **Net Effect**: Long profits = Short losses (and vice versa)

## PnL Calculation Methods

### Unrealized PnL
```
For Long Positions:
Unrealized PnL = (Current Price - Entry Price) × Position Size

For Short Positions:
Unrealized PnL = (Entry Price - Current Price) × Position Size
```

### Realized PnL
```
Realized PnL = (Exit Price - Entry Price) × Position Size - Fees
```

### Example Calculations
```
Scenario: BTC price moves from $45,000 to $50,000

Long Position (1 BTC):
- Unrealized PnL = ($50,000 - $45,000) × 1 = +$5,000

Short Position (1 BTC):
- Unrealized PnL = ($45,000 - $50,000) × 1 = -$5,000

Total PnL: +$5,000 + (-$5,000) = $0 ✓
```

## System-Wide PnL Tracking

### Aggregate Position Tracking
```
Total Long Exposure = Sum of all long positions
Total Short Exposure = Sum of all short positions
Net Exposure = Total Long - Total Short

When Net Exposure = 0:
- Perfect balance between longs and shorts
- Exchange has no directional risk
- All PnL is internal to users
```

### Example System State
```
User A: Long 2 BTC at $45,000
User B: Short 1 BTC at $45,000
User C: Short 1 BTC at $45,000

Total Long: 2 BTC
Total Short: 2 BTC
Net Exposure: 0 BTC

Price moves to $50,000:
User A PnL: +$10,000
User B PnL: -$5,000
User C PnL: -$5,000
Total PnL: $0 ✓
```

## Funding Rate Impact on PnL

### Funding Payments
```
Positive Funding Rate (Longs pay Shorts):
- Long positions: PnL decreases
- Short positions: PnL increases
- Net effect: Reduces long bias

Negative Funding Rate (Shorts pay Longs):
- Long positions: PnL increases
- Short positions: PnL decreases
- Net effect: Reduces short bias
```

### Example Funding Impact
```
Funding Rate: 0.1% (positive)
Total Long Value: $1,000,000
Total Short Value: $1,000,000

Long Payment: $1,000,000 × 0.1% = $1,000
Short Receipt: $1,000,000 × 0.1% = $1,000

Net PnL Impact: $0 (funding is internal transfer)
```

## Liquidation Impact on System PnL

### Liquidation Mechanics
```
When a position is liquidated:
1. Position is closed at market price
2. Trader loses their margin
3. Insurance fund may cover losses
4. Remaining users' PnL is unaffected
```

### Example Liquidation Scenario
```
User A: Long 1 BTC at $45,000, 10x leverage
User B: Short 1 BTC at $45,000

Price drops to $40,000:
User A: Liquidated, loses $4,500 margin
User B: Unrealized PnL +$5,000

System PnL: -$4,500 + $5,000 = +$500
Insurance Fund: -$500 (covers exchange loss)
Net System PnL: $0 ✓
```

## Open Interest and PnL

### Open Interest Definition
```
Open Interest = Total number of outstanding contracts
= Total Long Positions = Total Short Positions
```

### PnL Distribution
```
High Open Interest:
- More participants
- Better liquidity
- Smoother PnL distribution
- Lower price impact

Low Open Interest:
- Fewer participants
- Higher volatility
- Concentrated PnL impact
- Higher price impact
```

## Risk Management Implications

### Exchange Risk
```
When Net Exposure ≠ 0:
- Exchange has directional risk
- Price movements affect exchange PnL
- Risk management strategies needed
- Hedging may be required
```

### User Risk
```
Individual Risk Factors:
- Position size relative to capital
- Leverage used
- Market volatility
- Liquidation proximity
- Funding rate exposure
```

## PnL Attribution

### Market Movement PnL
```
Price-based PnL:
- Long positions: Profit on price increases
- Short positions: Profit on price decreases
- Zero-sum across all users
```

### Funding Rate PnL
```
Time-based PnL:
- Periodic payments between positions
- Encourages price convergence
- Internal transfer mechanism
```

### Fee-based PnL
```
Transaction costs:
- Trading fees reduce user PnL
- Exchange revenue
- Not zero-sum (exchange profit)
```

## System Monitoring

### Key Metrics
```
1. Total Open Interest
2. Net Exposure (Long - Short)
3. Average Leverage
4. Funding Rate
5. Liquidation Volume
6. Insurance Fund Balance
```

### Risk Indicators
```
High Risk Scenarios:
- Large net exposure
- High average leverage
- Low insurance fund
- High liquidation volume
- Extreme funding rates
```

## Implementation Considerations
