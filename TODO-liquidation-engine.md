- [x] Implement position transfer method: `receivePosition(position, bankruptcyPrice)`
- [x] Add liquidation engine position tracking in main exchange state
- [x] Create methods to calculate unrealized P&L on liquidation positions
- [x] Add liquidation engine to exchange initialization

### Position Accounting Verification
- [ ] Add validation function: `verifyZeroSum()` - ensures longs = shorts

## Phase 2: UI Visibility üëÅÔ∏è

### Liquidation Engine Display Panel

  - [x] Side (Long/Short)
  - [x] Size  
  - [x] Entry Price (bankruptcy price)
  - [x] Current Mark Price
  - [x] Unrealized P&L
  - [x] Time Since Transfer
- [x] Add liquidation engine summary stats:
  - [x] Total positions held
  - [x] Total unrealized P&L
  - [x] Insurance fund exposure
- [x] Color coding: Green for profitable, Red for losing positions

### Real-time Updates
- [x] Update liquidation engine positions on price changes

## Phase 3: Manual Liquidation Controls üéÆ

### Step-by-Step Liquidation Interface
- [x] Add "Manual Liquidation Controls" panel

  - [x] "Try Order Book Liquidation"
  - [x] "Execute ADL"
  - [x] "Force Close at Market"
- [x] Add confirmation dialog for each liquidation action
- [ ] Show preview of liquidation impact before execution

### Liquidation Progress Tracking
- [ ] Add liquidation status for each position:
  - [ ] "Pending" - just transferred
  - [ ] "Attempting Order Book" - trying market liquidation
  - [ ] "Order Book Failed" - no liquidity
  - [ ] "ADL Required" - insurance fund insufficient
  - [ ] "Completed" - successfully closed
- [ ] Add liquidation attempt history log
- [ ] Show time spent in each liquidation stage

## Phase 4: Order Book Liquidation üìä

### Market Liquidation Attempts
- [ ] Implement `attemptOrderBookLiquidation(position, maxSlippage)`
- [ ] Add order book depth analysis for liquidation feasibility
- [ ] Create aggressive liquidation orders (market orders with size limits)
- [ ] Implement partial liquidation if order book insufficient for full size
- [ ] Add slippage calculation and reporting

### Insurance Fund Integration
- [ ] Calculate profit/loss from order book liquidations
- [ ] Update insurance fund balance after successful liquidations
- [ ] Track insurance fund exposure for pending liquidations
- [ ] Add insurance fund depletion warnings
- [ ] Implement insurance fund threshold checks

### Liquidation Execution Logic
- [ ] Add liquidation priority queue (FIFO by default)
- [ ] Implement maximum liquidation size per attempt
- [ ] Add cooldown periods between liquidation attempts
- [ ] Create liquidation failure handling and retry logic

## Phase 5: ADL Integration üîÑ

### ADL Candidate Selection
- [ ] Integrate with existing ADL scoring system
- [ ] Filter candidates by opposite side to liquidation position
- [ ] Implement ADL candidate ranking and selection
- [ ] Add ADL candidate notification system

### Forced Trade Execution
- [ ] Create `executeADL(liquidationPosition, adlCandidates)` method
- [ ] Implement forced trades at liquidation engine's cost basis
- [ ] Handle partial ADL when single position can't absorb full size
- [ ] Update ADL'd trader positions and balances
- [ ] Remove liquidation position after successful ADL

### ADL Fairness and Limits
- [ ] Implement maximum ADL amount per trader per time period
- [ ] Add ADL exemptions for positions below minimum size
- [ ] Create ADL impact reporting for affected traders
- [ ] Add ADL priority indicators in position displays

## Phase 6: Advanced Features üöÄ

### Liquidation Analytics
- [ ] Add liquidation success rate tracking
- [ ] Create liquidation time analytics (order book vs ADL)
- [ ] Implement liquidation cost analysis
- [ ] Add insurance fund performance metrics

### Risk Management
- [ ] Add maximum liquidation engine position limits
- [ ] Implement liquidation engine exposure monitoring
- [ ] Create emergency liquidation procedures
- [ ] Add system-wide liquidation cascade detection

### User Experience
- [ ] Add liquidation notifications for affected users
- [ ] Create liquidation history view
- [ ] Implement liquidation impact estimator
- [ ] Add liquidation engine status indicators

## Phase 7: Testing and Validation ‚úÖ

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test position transfer mechanics
- [ ] Validate zero-sum invariant maintenance
- [ ] Test insurance fund calculations
- [ ] Verify ADL execution logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test full liquidation cascade scenarios
- [ ] Validate order book liquidation with real market data
- [ ] Test insurance fund depletion scenarios
- [ ] Verify ADL fairness under extreme conditions

### Stress Testing
- [ ] Test with multiple simultaneous liquidations
- [ ] Simulate extreme market movements
- [ ] Test insurance fund depletion recovery
- [ ] Validate system stability under liquidation pressure

## Implementation Notes üìù

### Starting Point (Phase 1 Priority)
1. **First**: Create basic liquidation engine structure
2. **Second**: Add liquidation engine positions display
3. **Third**: Implement manual liquidation trigger button
4. **Fourth**: Add position transfer mechanism

### Key Dependencies
- Existing ADL system (needs integration)
- Position management system
- Insurance fund tracking
- Order book depth analysis

### Critical Success Factors
- Zero-sum invariant never broken
- All liquidation steps manually controllable
- Clear visibility into liquidation engine state
- Proper insurance fund accounting
- Fair ADL execution

## Current Status: üèÅ Ready to Start Phase 1

**Next Action**: Begin with liquidation engine class creation and basic position tracking.
